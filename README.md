Activity Tracking
•	The user should be able to enter physical activities they did.
•	The user should be able to choose from 5 different activities: Running, Walking, Biking, Swimming or Skating.
•	The user should be able to enter the amount of time in minutes they did the activity.
•	The user should also be able to add comment, like “This felt easy”, or “My knee hurts after 10 minutes”. The database should track what time the activity was entered.
•	You should use fragments to show a ListView displays the activities, either ordered by time or as a daily summary of activities and time exercising. Users should be able to delete or edit previous entries, like changing the activity type or time spent, or change comments.
•	The application should calculate how many minutes of activity the user does per month, and also show how much activity the user did last month.
